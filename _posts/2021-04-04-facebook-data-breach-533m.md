Yesterday, phone numbers and in some cases also e-mails were leaked of 533 million Facebook users for free. I got my hands on a copy of the list of Swedish users and could confirm several numbers were authentic.

If you have linked your phone number and/or shared your email address with your Facebook profile you should assume that it has been compromised and that bad actors may abuse your information in attacks or phishing attempts. Be wary of suspicious text messages, calls or e-mails in the near future.

To decrease the risk of these kinds of breaches, unlink your phone number from platforms that allow SMS 2FA and instead use Authenticator apps wherever possible.

On Facebook you do this by entering Settings -> Safety & Login -> Edit Two Factor Authentication (https://www.facebook.com/security/2fac/settings)
